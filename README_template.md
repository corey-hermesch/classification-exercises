# Project Goal
 
* Discover drivers of ... (e.g. customer churn at telco)
* Use drivers to develop a machine learning model to classify ... (e.g. customer churn)
* Definition... (e.g. customer churn is defined as a customer cancelling their service with the company)
* This information could be used to... (e.g. intervene to prevent customer churn)

# The Plan
 
* Aquire data from (somewhere)
 
* Prepare data
   * Explain a little (remove columns, add columns, handle nulls...)
   * Ex: Create Engineered columns from existing data
       * Ex engineered column

 
* Explore data in search of drivers of upsets
   * Answer the following initial questions
       * Question 1
      
* Develop a Model to predict if a chess game will end in an upset
   * Use drivers identified in explore to build predictive models of different types
   * Evaluate models on train and validate data
   * Select the best model based on highest accuracy
   * Evaluate the best model on test data
 
* Draw conclusions
